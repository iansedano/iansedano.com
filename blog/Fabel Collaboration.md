  I was lucky enough to be neighbours with a music producer who recorded me

My first collab, Fábel was my neighbour, we met in the local craft beer bar downstairs. He initiated me into the world of music production. I wrote and performed all the acoustic guitar sounds on these tracks, which Fábel beautifully cut, sliced and arranged.
