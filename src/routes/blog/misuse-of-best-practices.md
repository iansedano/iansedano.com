description: When best practices aren't the best. Maybe they're just good, or the way we've always done things.

I'm not a fan of the term **best practices**. I think it's a [misnomer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Misnomer) that can lead to fragility. That said, we can't exactly do anything about the term -- it's a succinct way to communicate the concept of:

> A solution that is the lesser-of-evils which is recommended in most cases.

Languages are full of misnomers and I wholeheartedly embrace the evolution of language through slang, accidents, perversions and politics. I dislike the purist attitude that nitpicks any deviation from the "way it was in the beginning".

While the evolution of languages is good -- it's never unbounded -- culture coalesces around a shared understanding of words, so some resistance to [semantic change](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semantic_change) is healthy. If semantic change progresses unbounded, we'd quickly lose the ability to communicate with each other.

So, allow me this pedantic nitpick on the use of the term "best practices". I propose that we prefer to say "good" instead of "best", and generally be more precise with whether it's good, the standard way, or the way things have always been done and we're not sure why.

## When best isn't really the best

I believe that most software engineers would generally agree that the term "best practices" is simply another way to say the "standard" way. Most would not be so bold as to say that any one practice is the literal "best". There's [hubris](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hubris) in saying that any one thing is best -- especially in a scientifically driven field.

I'm sure there will be some cases in which some will confidently assert that a certain solution is best. But even in those clear cut situations, it will most likely only be the best that we are _currently aware of_. Think of Newton's laws of motion and how they break down at extreme scale. Or the theory of evolution, or heliocentricity. We've got a long history of having our fundamental ideas about the world challenged. Why should things be any different for software?

## Learning to Cycle

For beginners or anyone who is learning the ropes of any discipline, using established patterns allows you to apply patterns or actions without needless effort in weighing up alternatives. It allows you to rehearse what robust patterns look like and get a feel for how systems using them fit together. It can accelerate your learning. Much like using stabilizers on a bicycle.

Knowledge, in general, progresses by probes and adjustment. This description of the way knowledge progresses holds true for many different aspects of life -- mathematics, science, literature, even your emotional bearing in day-to-day life. That is, we make assumptions that are generally correct from our perspective at the time, and then adjust based on experience. On the whole, we experiment, we try things out, we get comfortable, we are surprised, and then we adjust.

When you follow established practices, even without understanding them, things work _almost_ all of the time.

## Earned Practice

The process of cognitive compression, or [chunking](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chunking_(psychology)>), allows us to create [heuristics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heuristic) to navigate the problems we are faced with. A heuristic can be derived from a best practice, but a heuristic can also be earned through experimentation and deliberate thought.

We can't earn _all_ our heuristics, and we can't take _everything_ for granted. So a middle ground is necessary. I believe that **by using the term "best" we're encouraging people to take things for granted**. I try to say "good" instead of "best" practices where possible.

I like to perform a small mental check every time I use or see the phrase "best practice". I ask myself "is it? really?". And most of the time I don't have time to think about it any further. But at least that leaves the door open for something better.

Of course, changing a common phrase doesn't solve the problem, it's just a small nudge in the "good" direction. Ultimately, I think we just need to be aware of our inherent limitations as thinking and feeling humans. For software engineers navigating what we know as best practices the [bandwagon effect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bandwagon_effect), and the [cargo cult programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cargo_cult_programming) phenomenon are particularly relevant. So, in the name of precision, I try to say "good practices" instead of "best practices", or at least, "the best practices we're aware of".

If you have any good stories about when best practices weren't the best, I'd love to hear them. Please share them with me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/iansedano).
