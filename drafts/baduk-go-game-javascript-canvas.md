[Go](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Go_(game)>), the game, not the language, is an ancient strategy game that had held up, until recently, as the only board game that hadn't been beated by an artificial intelligence.

If you want to learn about the story of how [Deep Mind's](https://www.deepmind.com/) [Alpha Go](https://www.deepmind.com/research/highlighted-research/alphago) beat the world champion, and modern legend, [Lee Sedol](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lee_Sedol), check out the fantastic [documentary](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXuK6gekU1Y).

Go has a few deceptively simple rules. If you are interested in learning, then here are some nice resources to get you started:

- [Pandanet tutorial](https://www.pandanet.co.jp/English/learning_go/learning_go_1.html)
- [Reddit thread on best resources to learn Go](https://www.reddit.com/r/baduk/comments/cdyndv/what_are_the_best_resources_to_learn_and_play_go/)

You can also mess around with the vanilla JavaScript and HTML Canvas version of a demonstration board below.
