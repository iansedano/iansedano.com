<script>
	import Bubbles from "$components/Bubbles.svelte"
	import BouncingBall from "$components/BouncingBall.svelte";
	import FractalTree from "$components/FractalTree.svelte"
	import Circles from "$components/Circles.svelte"
</script>

During the 2020 COVID-19 pandemic lockdown, I experimented and learned some JavaScript with the p5.js library. These are all based on starting points from [Daniel Schiffman](https://thecodingtrain.com/).
