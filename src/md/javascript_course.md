I authored a [JavaScript course](https://codingnomads.co/courses/learn-javascript-online-vanilla-javascript-basics) funded and hosted by [Coding Nomads](https://codingnomads.co/). It is suitable for beginners though some knowledge in another language or HTML and CSS is handy.

The great thing about JavaScript is that it's everywhere, all you need to get started is access to an internet browser on a laptop or desktop.

The start of the course is free, you just need to sign up for an account. To access the full course there is a monthly subscription fee that gives you access to the course and the forum.

Coding Nomads is a business committed to social change. When the Covid 19 pandemic hit in 2020, they supported me while making the transition to becoming a professional developer.
